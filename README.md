# Oxell Runtime

Rust runtime for the Oxell language.

See [compiler](https://github.com/ianmelendez95/haskelite) for project details.

## Rust Runtime

This project is a 'template' project for programs compiled by the Oxell compiler.
The compiler generates the [src/prog.rs](https://github.com/ianmelendez95/oxell-runtime/blob/master/src/prog.rs) file and compiles the final Rust project with `rustc`.
